# Fieldmanager Demos

A plugin to demonstrate [Fieldmanager](http://fieldmanager.org). Requires Fieldmanager, of course. This plugin adds:

* A slew of post types to demonstrate individual field types
* A taxonomy under the "Post" post type to demonstrate the Term context
* Pages under Users, Tools, and Settings to demonstrate the Submenu context
* Modifications to the edit user page through the User context

This plugin requires Fieldmanager 1.0-alpha or higher.
